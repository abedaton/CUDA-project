==47176== NVPROF is profiling process 47176, command: C:\Users\antoi\Desktop\CUDA\MyVectorAdd\x64\Debug\MyVectorAdd.exe
==47176== Warning: Unified Memory Profiling is not supported on the current configuration because a pair of devices without peer-to-peer support is detected on this multi-GPU setup. When peer mappings are not available, system falls back to using zero-copy memory. It can cause kernels, which access unified memory, to run slower. More details can be found at: http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#um-managed-memory
